#About this project!

I built this blogging web application with the intention to learn more about web technologies, as well as to level up as a developer. I built the back-end from scratch with PHP, and I used Zurb Foundation 6 for front-end styling. I built it by myself and tested by myself, so there might be random bugs that I haven't caught; if you come across a bug, please let me know. This app is no where near done because I want to add more functionalities and features to it.

Todo:

- Commenting system
- Like system
- URL rewriting (not really a functionality)
- Image posting for article
- AJAX functionality
- Search feature
- Sort feature
